If user is on `main`, ask them to create a new branch before committing.

Otherwise, follow these steps to create a concise and descriptive commit message:

- Please read local changes and compare them to current remote using git commands.
- Analyze what has changed, group similar changes together.
- For each group of changes, determine the intent and purpose.
- Summarize the changes in a concise commit message following the Conventional Commits format.
- Add yourself a task for each commit message and associated files.
- Once the process is complete, trigger a gated alignment with the user for each of the tasks.
- When user `approves`, finalize the commit with the generated message.
