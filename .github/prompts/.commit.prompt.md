> **NOTE:** Use commit instructions from [./.github/instructions/.commit.instructions.md](../instructions/.commit.instructions.md) as the primary source of truth for crafting commit messages.

1. Please peek into git log (last 50 entries) to identify common commit message patterns in this repository.
2. Pick best practices from there, keeping in mind that some of the commits aren't very good.
3. Then use `git status` (without additional arguments) to identify local changes to be committed.
4. Use `git diff` against current remote for each changed, added, or removed file to identify what changes has been made.
5. Group similar changes into a single commit and with a good and informative commit message, including inferred rationale.
6. Keep iterating until `git status` (without additional arguments) shows we are up to date.

## Guidelines for commits

- Prefer small commits focused on a single concern.
- Do not exceed 50 characters in the commit message.
- If required, add a detailed description in the commit body.
  - Use separate -m flags for title and body when committing via command line.
- Use imperative mood in the commit message title (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature").
- Reference relevant issues or tickets in the commit message if applicable.
