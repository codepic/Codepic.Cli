User wants to create a new module within the CLI repository.

If user didn't provide any details, ask the user what the module should do.

Once we have a rough idea of the module's purpose, start with global alignment protocol in order to figure out the rest of the required details to scaffold the module.

Be helpful and proactive in guiding the user through the process. Keep in mind that the user might not be familiar with PowerShell etc., so explain any technical stuff in laymen's terms and examples if needed.
