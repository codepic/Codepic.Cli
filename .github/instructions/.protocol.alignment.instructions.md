Global Alignment Protocol

- Trigger when instructions conflict, a decision touches repo-wide conventions, or requirements feel ambiguous/high-risk; note why alignment started before proceeding.
- Pause implementation and prepare options labeled accept:a|b|c|d (extend to e‚Ä¶ only if necessary). Each option must include: short title, summary, pros, cons, blast-radius scope, and a concise recommendation statement.
  - Use icons to add clarity: ‚úÖ for pros, ‚ö†Ô∏è for cons, üìå for recommendations, and üí• for blast radius.
- Present the option block and wait. Valid replies: accept:<id> to pick, question:<text> for clarification, adjust:<text> to tweak, cancel to abort alignment.
- Once decided, restate the chosen option.
- Only when the user picks accept:<id>, proceed with a next alignment question.
- Keep asking alignment questions until all ambiguities are resolved.
- Keep this file as the single source of truth; other instruction files should reference it instead of duplicating steps, so future changes require edits in only one place.
