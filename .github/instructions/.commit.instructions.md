# Commit Message Guidance

Use intent-driven subjects that stay short (≤72 characters) and read well in `git log`. We follow a lightweight Conventional Commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Keep the taxonomy stable so the history remains easy to scan.

## Subject line rules

- Format the first line as `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
- `type` must be lowercase from the allowed list below.
- `scope` is optional but encouraged; use lowercase kebab-case and keep it short.
- Write the subject in present-tense imperative voice (“Add enabler manifest binary paths”).
- Keep the subject ≤72 characters; avoid trailing punctuation.
- Reference only one logical change per commit so the subject stays descriptive.

### Allowed types

- `feat` — new user-facing capability or CLI task.
- `fix` — user-visible bug fix or regression patch.
- `docs` — documentation, instruction, or README updates.
- `chore` — repository maintenance, tooling, or chores with no product impact.
- `refactor` — behavior-neutral code restructuring.
- `test` — new or updated tests without other functional changes.
- `build` — build pipeline, packaging, or dependency script adjustments.

### Common scopes

- `cli` — baseline tasks or bootstrapper changes under `modules/.tasks.ps1` or `.build.ps1`.
- `enablers` — enabler lifecycle, manifests, or docs.
- `docs` — top-level documentation under `docs/`.
- `instructions` — `.github/instructions/**` updates.
- `schema` — JSON schemas or validation assets.

Scopes are optional; add new ones sparingly when they help disambiguate history and keep this document up to date.

## Body text

- Body paragraphs are optional; include them when the subject alone cannot explain _why_ the change happened.
- Wrap body lines at 72 characters, separating paragraphs with blank lines.
- Use bullet points for discrete notes; describe rationale, side effects, or follow-up work.

## Examples from this repository

- `docs(enablers): document enabler lifecycle`
- `feat(cli): add install-enabler task`
- `chore: rename workspace`

Aim for consistency with the examples above so future `git log --oneline` output stays tidy.
