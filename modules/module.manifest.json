        "  - If not,  ask the user to choose a good name for the CLI fitting their context. e.g. do not use 'codepic' as it's just a placeholder name. User should use their own alias.",
        "  - Give suggestions if needed.",
        "  - The alias will be the name of the command they will run on the terminal. Therefore it should be short (to type) and intuitive (discoverable).",
        "  - You can use the gated alignment protocol in the .github/instructions/.protocol.alignment.instructions.md if needed.",
        "3. Once the user has chosen a name, run `./.build.ps1 . init -Alias {CLI}` to initialize the CLI.",
        "4. After initializing, test the CLI functionality by running `{CLI} . lint` to ensure it's set up correctly.",
        "5. Finally, ask the user if they'd like a tutorial?",
        "  - If they choose yes, introduce the user to the CLI features and how to use them.",
        "  - You should give them small and targeted pieces of information one at a time and prompt them to say 'next' to continue to the next piece of information until the tutorial is complete."
